        <h3>Izzy Goo</h3>
        <p>This gorgeous lady is Antoinette. She is a spicy little firecracker who knows what she wants in life. A quiet home with a consistent routine is very important for her to feel happy and secure. She’s ready to find that perfect warm spot in your window where she can watch the world go by. She’s always up for a chat or a game, but prefers for things to be on her terms. Because she has a bit of a sassy side, older children are recommended. Antoinette can’t wait to find her forever home. Is it yours?</p>

        <h3>Peanut Butter</h3>
        <p>I’m Peanut Butter! I couldn’t be more excited about being someone’s new furry friend. I have been looking for someone to spend time with me and hang out! I adore being with people and want to give you all the love you’ll let me! I am more than just a pretty face; I have beauty radiating from inside of me. There are lots of dogs out there but I am one of a kind. I will need to go to a home where there are no cats. A training consult will be provided prior to my adoption in order for us to start things out on the right paw!</p>

        <h3>Chuck</h3>
        <p>My name is Chuck and I’m looking for a warm lap to lie on. It takes me a little time to trust new people in new places, but give me a bit and we’ll be great friends. That’s probably how I will greet most new people, but I’ve heard it’s a somewhat endearing trait. I really do enjoy getting daily bouts of exercise, and a Basic Manners class, like those offered here at OHS, would help further boost my confidence in new situations. I’ve come here with the hope of finding my forever home, and you seem like just the type of person I want to spend forever with. I am in the second chance program and I come from Fresno Humane Society. How about we visit for a while and see if we’re a match like I think we might be?</p>
